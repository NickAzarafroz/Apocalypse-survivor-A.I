# Apocalypse-survivor-A.I

## Project Discription
This repository showcases my work for the "Gameplay Programming" course at DAE Howest. 
I've implemented various common A.I. techniques as intermediate milestones throughout the course. 
Towards the end of the course, I combined these techniques to create an A.I. agent focused on surviving as long as possible in an apocalyptic world.

## Project Overview
The A.I. agent in this project makes decisions such as when to eliminate enemies, when to pick up items, which items to use, and when to loot houses. 

## Topics Covered
- Steering Behaviours
- Graph Theory
- A* Pathfinding
- Finite State Machine
- Behaviour Trees
- Influence Maps
